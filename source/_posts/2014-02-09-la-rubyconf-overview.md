# Introduction

I was fortunate enough to attend LA RubyConf 2014:

* Drove my Spark EV to a charging station close to the hotel in Burbank and paid for charging rather than parking.
* Good to see familiar faces.
* Sessions were as good this year as the previous ones.

I only took detailed notes on one presentation, the
[Pair Programming](/presentation/2014/02/09/la-rubyconf-pair-programming/) session by Joe Moore.

Otherwise, my notes on the rest of the 1-day conference are here.

# The Presentations

## As Easy As Rails

Justin Searls

@searls

works for Test Double

Say hello@testdouble.com

Slides: [As Easy As Rails](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/as-easy-as-rails).
Fast moving talk on the risk of trying to do
everything in Rails when functionality is moving to the client-side.  Great presentation.

## Addressing Sexism

Summary: thoughtful talk.

More notes [here](/presentation/2014/02/09/la-rubyconf-addressing-sexism/).

## C Ruby

Summary: [persuasive presentation](/presentation/2014/02/09/la-rubyconf-c-ruby/)
of the synergy between **Ruby** and **C**.

## Writing Games with Ruby

Presenter's confession: writing games if FUN!  *My confession: Looks much easier than I thought it would.*

Because: Ruby!

My further notes [here](/presentation/2014/02/09/la-rubyconf-writing-games-with-ruby/).

## TDD and SOLID Design

My understanding grew of how a working knowledge of SOLID can really make your TDD coding easier, faster to develop,
and easier to change.

Great [presentation](/presentation/2014/02/09/la-rubyconf-tdd-and-solid-design/).


## Write Small Things

*Summary: Keep your methods and classes small for most maintainable code.*

Since I already try to do this,
it was interesting and useful to find some
[specific techniques and justifications](/presentation/2014/02/09/la-rubyconf-write-small-things/).

## Go(lang) for the Rubyist

The one presentation I missed; here's his presentation: [Go(lang) for the Rubyist](http://www.slideshare.net/markykang/golang-for-the-rubyist?utm_content=buffer5f0c8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).  I had to leave early for another commitment; dang it.

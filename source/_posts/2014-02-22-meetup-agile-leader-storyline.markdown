## Agile Leader Storyline ("Your Life is a Movie")

I attended a very interesting presentation by agile master Scott Dunn at the last
[Agile Socal meetup](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&gid=1833155&type=member&item=5837424884862439427&qid=fdcd7763-0ea9-41f5-85f0-191df40a657e&goback=%2Egmp_1833155)
about how "living a better story" can enhance your scrum master performance (or any part of your left, for that matter).

*O No! Not another 'self-help' experience!*

But, lo, I liked it!

### The Hook

Here's how Scott explained it:

Exercise:

1.  Write down where you expect to be in 1 year.
1.  Write down where you expect to be in 5 years.  *been there, done that (yawn)*
1.  Now, pretend your life is a script in a movie.  Now where do you expect to be?  *huh?*

### *Okay, go on*

Scott then asked us to answer the following question about movie plot lines:

*  Plot A: Introduced to the main character.  Thngs get better for him.  What's the main character like?
*  Plot B: Introduced to the main character.  Bad shit happens to him and he has to deal with it.  What's the main
character like afterwards?

Scott pointed out that no one makes movies using plot A because it would be *boring*.  *(I suspect that's what
travelogues are about.)*

Indeed, virtually all commercial movies deal with Plot B, because **stories** are all about how people change in the
process of overcoming difficulty.

I.e.:

* Difficult: interesting
* Easy: boring

Scott suggests that this applies to our own lives as well as movies.  ** *D'oh,
except somehow this was a relevation, er, revelation to
me.* **

Frankly, the rest of the presentation, while very good, simply filled in the ramifications,
and references to the material he uses is in the links below.

At the end of his presentation, I thanked him.

When I got home, I tore up my travelogue and am working on a script.  I'll let you know how it goes.

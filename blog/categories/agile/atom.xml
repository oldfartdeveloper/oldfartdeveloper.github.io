<p>I attended a very interesting presentation by agile master Scott Dunn at the last
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;gid=1833155&amp;type=member&amp;item=5837424884862439427&amp;qid=fdcd7763-0ea9-41f5-85f0-191df40a657e&amp;goback=%2Egmp_1833155">Agile Socal meetup</a>
about how &ldquo;living a better story&rdquo; can enhance your scrum master performance (or any part of your left, for that matter).</p>

<p><em>O No! Not another &lsquo;self-help&rsquo; experience!</em></p>

<p>But, lo, I liked it!</p>

<h3>The Hook</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how Scott explained it:</p>

<p>Exercise:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write down where you expect to be in 1 year.</li>
<li>Write down where you expect to be in 5 years.  <em>been there, done that (yawn)</em></li>
<li>Now, pretend your life is a script in a movie.  Now where do you expect to be?  <em>huh?</em></li>
</ol>


<h3><em>Okay, go on</em></h3>

<p>Scott then asked us to answer the following question about movie plot lines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plot A: Introduced to the main character.  Thngs get better for him.  What&rsquo;s the main character like?</li>
<li>Plot B: Introduced to the main character.  Bad shit happens to him and he has to deal with it.  What&rsquo;s the main
character like afterwards?</li>
</ul>


<p>Scott pointed out that no one makes movies using plot A because it would be <em>boring</em>.  <em>(I suspect that&rsquo;s what
travelogues are about.)</em></p>

<p>Indeed, virtually all commercial movies deal with Plot B, because <strong>stories</strong> are all about how people change in the
process of overcoming difficulty.</p>

<p>I.e.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Difficult: interesting</li>
<li>Easy: boring</li>
</ul>


<p>Scott suggests that this applies to our own lives as well as movies.  <strong> <em>D'oh,
except somehow this was a relevation, er, revelation to
me.</em> </strong></p>

<p>Frankly, the rest of the presentation, while very good, simply filled in the ramifications,
and references to the material he uses is in the links below.</p>

<p>At the end of his presentation, I thanked him.</p>

<p>When I got home, I tore up my travelogue and am working on a script.  I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>
